Noteworthy Events,,,,He moved further up stream and out of frame on the center island before finishing his crossing,started to cross directly behind the bus as it started to drive away,,,The pedestrian walked into frame already on the center island so we dont know how long they were in the middle of the road or where they initially crossed,,The group seemed to be a mother and teen daughter. The crossing phase ended while they were on the middle island so they had to wait for the next cycle to start,,Finished crossing very close to car,,,,Car had to come to a complete stop in the active roadway to allow him to finish walking. The pedestrian also showed zero haste to get out of the cars way,"The two kids were waiting at the center island while traffic was flowing, but one car stopped to let them go with a line of cars piling up behind it in the intersection",,,Pedestrian had to wait at the island for the second crossing phase to start,,,Almost finished crossing during the crossing phase but just ran out of time ,,,cars had to stop for the pedestrian during the first part of his crossing,Man ran across between cars with his small child. One car switched lanes to go around the parked cars which could have caused a dangerous situation as they were not able to see the group  untill they had gone all the way around the car,,"The group ran across the whole road, forcing cars in all lanes to either stop or wait for them to pass before proceding",,
Vehicle Traffic,,,,,,,,,,,,the car that came close to him had to straddle lanes to avoid him because the pedestrian was where the car needed to be ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
General Reviewer Notes,,,,,"After he crossed the road he immediatly tried to flag down a bus on the other side of the road, but once the first bus passed he walked away, possibly to another bus stop that the bus would actually stop at",It seemed like they finished during the crossing sequence but it was hard to tell because cars started moving right after they finished crossing,It seemed like they finished during the crossing sequence but it was hard to tell because cars started moving right after they finished crossing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
